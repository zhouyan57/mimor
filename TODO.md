# project and file

ProjectList -- last update at the top
ProjectFileList -- last update at the top

`this.memory.post` should use returned data

- [backend] post should return data `created_at`

  ```
  const data = await this.remote.post(username, project)
  await this.memory.post(username, data)
  ```

[maybe] quit abstract over fetch

- the abstraction is to shallow
- for better error report
