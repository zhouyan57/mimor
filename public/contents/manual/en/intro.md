Inspired by [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
and [Orbit](https://withorbit.com)
and [flomo](https://flomoapp.com),
I want to create an memory helping App.

Some features I wanted:

- Web based.
- Use plaintext to write cards (custom XML for structured information).
- Some simple community features, so that people like learning can learn from each others.

Let's call this App **mimor**.

**mimor** `/ˈmi.mor/` adj.: mindful; existing in the memory or mind, known.

- From Proto-Indo-European `*(s)mer-`: to be mindful, remember, take careful thought of.
- Middle Low German `mīmeren, mīmern`: to ponder, reflect.
- Dutch `mijmeren`: to muse, reflect deeply, think to oneself.
- Old Norse `Mīmir`: Norse god of memory.

I want to explore the design by using this App.

Some keywords currently in my mind:

- **Active recall**

  When learning, when want to remember something,
  actively making them cards, to test ourself in recall.

- **Spaced repetition**

  During recall, cards will be spaced in time,
  more and more sparse, to gain long-term memory.

- **Recommending to ourself**

  When want to concentrate on something,
  maybe we can setup a little reminder,
  in the format of a sequence of questions and answers.
