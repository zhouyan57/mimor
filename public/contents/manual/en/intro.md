- **Active recall**

  When learning, when want to remember something,
  actively making them cards, to test ourself in recall.

- **Spaced repetition**

  During recall, cards will be spaced in time,
  more and more sparse, to gain long-term memory.

- **Recommending to ourself**

  When want to concentrate on something,
  maybe we can setup a little reminder,
  in the format of a sequence of questions and answers.
